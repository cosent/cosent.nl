Truly open, social organisations participate in a paradigm shift.
{{< /intro >}}

In [Sustainability by Design](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0300158432/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cosent-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0300158432), John Ehrenfield argues
that creating a more sustainable, flourishing world requires
a mind shift from *having* to *being* - from hyperindividualistic
consumerism towards authentic, caring relationships as the
defining characteristic of "who I am".

This provides an interesting lens on social networking and
the different modes of engagement organizations can pursue.

### To have or to be, that is the question

In the traditional *having* mode, organizations "have" customers
and use social networks to reach out to those customers.
In this mind set, social is just a new channel to be used
for broadcasting commercial messages. Conveniently, this
allows traditional measures to be used for the effectiveness
of social marketing, like reach across target demographics.
Even more conveniently, this active/passive model of engagement
presupposes that the (active) organization is in control of the
relationship with the (passive) public.

Of course, this is not a sustainable model of engagement anymore. True
engagement means there's a two-way conversation. Having a two-way
engagement with their customers requires that organizations listen
to their customers, and adapt. Only organizations that listen and
respond to their customers will be able to sustain long-term engagement.

Organizations adopting this *being* mode pursue conversations as a
co-creative effort where meaning and value are created as a joint
effort between the organization as a hub and its wider network
of client and supplier relationships. Strategy in this mind set is
not something that is set by the Board, but instead becomes an
ongoing adaptation process involving all layers of the organizational
eco-system.

### Networked engagement as a core competence

This elevates social networking from a mere marketing/sales channel
in the *having* mode, to a strategic engagement in the *being* mode.
Consequently, performance measures should be redefined away from
instrumental objectives, and instead focus on learning, innovation and co-creation as key metrics in evaluating social networking effectiveness.

If you're interested in exploring the philosphical foundations of this
reasoning, you might want to look into the work of [Fromm](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0826417388/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cosent-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0826417388), [Heidegger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidegger)
or [Maturana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humberto_Maturana) - especially the latter's [autopoiesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis) concept is relevant
for the way we evolve or sense of self as persons and organizations
in the age of networking.
