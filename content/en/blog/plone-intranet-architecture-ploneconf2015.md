A highly technical talk, that helps you understand how the ploneintranet stack is structured, and why it works the way it does. 

After watching this talk, you should feel confident in deciding whether ploneintranet is a good fit for your client project - or not. As a developer you'll gain insight into some innovative components you might want to re-use in new Plone5 projects, such as personalized data structures, theme switching, async, and context-specific browser layers. 

The talk opens with a mini-tutorial on code-free frontend interaction design with Patternslib/Mockup and the awesome powers of pat-inject in action.
