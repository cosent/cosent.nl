Creating a new open source digital workplace platform.
{{< /intro >}}

At the [Plone Conference 2014](http://2014.ploneconf.org) in Bristol, Guido Stevens presented the Plone Intranet Consortium
to an audience of Plone core developers. The presentation focused on the need for a new business
model for open source development, and the specific traction we're achieving within the Consortium already.

The "spare time" model of doing open source is broken. We need a better model.
In the Plone Intranet Consortium, a dozen Plone companies are jointly investing in
the creation of a high-quality out-of-the-box open source intranet platform based on Plone.
What is different is not just the funding model, but also the design-first approach we're taking.

Slides of the presentation are [available on SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/GuidoStevens/plone-intranet-consortium-united-we-stand-divided-we-fall "Plone Intranet Consortium - united we stand, divided we fall").

### Project Mercury

The Consortium is now working on creating the alpha release, codename: Mercury, which is scheduled early 2015.
We'll inform a wider audience via a website and a series of workshops, in the run-up to the Mercury release. Stay tuned!
