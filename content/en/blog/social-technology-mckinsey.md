Increasing adoption of social technologies is fuelled by significant performance benefits, a McKinsey study shows.
{{< /intro >}}

Social technogies have reached critical scale, a [McKinsey study](https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Business_Technology/How_social_technologies_are_extending_the_organization_2888) shows:
72% of organizations are deploying at least one social technology,
and more than 40% are now using both social networking and blogging.

Maybe even more notable than those adoption numbers are the performance
improvements experienced by organizations covered in the survey.

McKinsey classifies organizations into four groups, based on whether or not
they achieved **more than ten percent improvement** in Web 2.0 related performance
dimensions on either internal networking, external networking, both or none.

A substantial number of organizations has been able to reap 10% or more performance
improvements by using social technology for either internal networking, external
networking or both.

Market leaders typically reap benefits from internal networking, but shy away
from external networking.

Externally networked and fully networked organizations
benefit by using social technologies for customer and partner outreach,
blurring the boundaries of the organization.

### New business processes may radically improve performance

The process improvements that yield most benefits are: scanning the external
environment, and using social technologies to more fluidly match employees with tasks.
Integrating web technologies into the daily workflow, is the most effective way
to maintain or improve competitive position.

Using social technologies to assess employee performance has a strong *negative*
effect on performance. Micro-monitoring employee behaviour does not mix well with a culture of
trust and transparency, needed to reap the benefits of social work processes.

Interestingly, the rate of *change* in social technology adoption is a stronger predictor
of superior performance, than is the absolute level of social technology deployment.
In other words: becoming social is more important than being social. This and other
indicators in the survey suggest that ongoing transformation and change are key qualities
that lead to superior performance, and social media adoption may be just one of the
symptoms of a more fundamental change-oriented strategy.

Survey respondents expect social technologies to modify many of their organizations'
current processes, especially in fully networked organizations, and even more so
if current technological constraints were to be removed. That points to significant
additional benefits that can be reaped further down the line.

The scale of social technology adoption and the performance improvements gained,
in combination with deep technological and competitive dynamics, creates significant
opportunities for companies adopting social technologies and networking practices
to reconfigure their work processes and value-creation fabric.
