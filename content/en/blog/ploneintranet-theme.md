{{< intro >}}
Front-end development for ploneintranet has started.
{{< /intro >}}

While many people are still enjoying the beach, we're already gearing up to accelerate design and development
for Plone Intranet this fall.

Following the Mosaic sprint and a ploneintranet summit in Gatwick we're now
collaborating with with [Syslab](http://syslab.com) and [Cornelis Kolbach](http://cornae.com).
to turn wireframes and high-fidelity designs of social interactions
into HTML/CSS/Javascript prototypes,
using [Patternslib](http://patternslib.com) (similar to [Mockup](http://plone.github.io/mockup/dev/)).

This is a screenshot of some of the frontend work in progress:

We'll extend this work in the run-up to the [Berlin sprint](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/berlin-plone-sprint-2014/project-home) in September,
which will be focussed on extending [plonesocial](https://github.com/cosent/plonesocial.suite) and integrating it with [ploneintranet](https://github.com/ploneintranet).

Our goal is to provide a workable code base, that documents much of the design
decisions we're making in a way that enables community collaboration.

[The backend code](https://github.com/ploneintranet) we're working on is already open and [published](http://www.netsight.co.uk/blog/plone-intranet-development-sprint-update-july-2014):
see e.g. [experimental.securityindexing](http://www.netsight.co.uk/blog/optimising-local-role-security-reindexing-in-plone/), [ploneintranet.workspace](https://github.com/ploneintranet/ploneintranet.workspace) and [collective.dynamicmosaic](https://github.com/collective/collective.dynamicmosaic).
We expect to fully open up the frontend code before the Plone conference this fall.

Please [contact](/contact/) us if you're not a member of the Plone Intranet Consortium and would like
to get involved and gain commit access to our development repositories.
