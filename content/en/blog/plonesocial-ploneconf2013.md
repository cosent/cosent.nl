[Slides are available on Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/GuidoStevens/plonesocial-roadmap-26871960 "PloneSocial Roadmap — PloneConf 2013").

At the [World Plone Conference](http://ploneconf.org) 2013, Cosent presented a roadmap for the [PloneSocial suite](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plonesocial.suite): a social business solution integrated into the open source Plone CMS.

The PloneSocial roadmap is derived from the
[Digital Workplace Technology Roadmap](/roadmap.html) framework we've developed at Cosent.

The video below gives an overview of the current PloneSocial feature set. It's part of the presentation above at the "demo" slide. No audio available.
