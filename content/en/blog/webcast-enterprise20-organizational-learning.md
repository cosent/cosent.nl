A conversation between Bj√∂rn Negelmann, Eugene Fernandez and Guido Stevens.

Some key points:

* We are bombarded with action, and need to carve out "slack" time to enable reflection
* Enterprise 2.0 technologies can be used as "trojan mice" for bottom-up change efforts
* How can we design/deploy Enterprise 2.0 in ways that support reflection and deep change?
