{{< intro >}}
To thrive in the current turbulent business environment, organizations need to embrace disruption.
{{< /intro >}}

International management bestsellers like [Blue Ocean Strategy](http://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/),
provide recipes for being bold and crafting new business models,
that offer vistas of fantastic profitability.

The interest in [disruptive innovation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation)
obscures an uncomfortable reality: many more businesses
are being *disrupted* than are being *disruptive*.

It's a bit like the saying about old age:
Everyone wants to grow old, but nobody wants to *be* old.

### Face the future

Avoiding disruption is a futile, and loosing, strategy.
Just take a look at the macro forces that are shaping today's business landscape: [^first]

Globalization and interconnectedness
:   Pervasive interdependence leads to complex, unpredictable dynamics

Social responsibility
:   Sustainable development and stakeholder value-oriented perspectives challenge organizations to integrate multi-faceted value creation mechanisms

Accelerating pace of innovation
:   Waves of disruptive changes quickly erode the status quo

Chaotic and turbulent competitive landscape
:   Lower barriers to entry and technology-driven innovation generate an unpredictable dynamic

Dynamical networked value-added chains
:   Superior competitiveness and agility require a strong eco-system of dynamic supply network relations

Global shift to Asia
:   A shift of the center of gravity of the global economy creates new business opportunities and threats

Knowledge commodification
:   Technical knowledge codified in products, software and business processes can be acquired in the market or quickly recreated by competitors

Customer power
:   With the world at their fingertips, customers demand superior value experiences

The combined impact of these trends results in a fast moving, highly unpredictable, turbulent business environment, where only one thing is certain: you *will* be disrupted.

### Prepare to be disrupted

Fortunately, to paraphrase Cruijff: every disadvantage has its advantage.

To thrive in this turbulent environment, organizations need to embrace and welcome change, reward bottom-up initiatives, reconfigure fluidly, tolerate a degree of messiness and have a significant risk appetite. While some of those values (not the messiness :) may sound great on paper, in practice each of these values involves friction and stress levels that may not be a pleasant experience. You don't move to such a position, unless compelled by external forces, like disruptive competitors that threaten your very organizational continuity.

Compelled or not: once your organization has embraced change, increased agility and responsiveness and has mobilized all resources - in short, once you've accepted being disrupted as a reality - now you're in an excellent position to start doing some disruption onto others as well.

In short: to become disruptive, prepare to be disrupted.
