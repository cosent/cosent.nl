A social network analysis of the commit histories in the Zope and Plone development repositories.

Increasingly open source (OS) software development is organized in a way similar
to how a corporation would organize development. This paper examines this
corporatizing effect by studying the relationship between peer-oriented social
structures and goal-oriented technical structures in the Plone community.

Social structures are said to exhibit assortative mixing, a like attract like
characteristic whereas technical structures exhibits an opposite effect of
disassortative mixing. Our first finding suggests that the patterns of
collaborative contributions and interdependences among software modules exhibit
the characteristic of disassortative mixing. 

Specifically, Plone developers were
more likely to contribute to modules that already have a high concentration of
contributions, which in turn lead to an increase in module reuse over time. This
finding contributes to the debate of whether social systems are strictly
assortative, and technological systems strictly disassortative (Newman, 2002).

Our second contribution concerns the impact of corporatizing OSS projects,
suggesting that corporatizing OS development had the effect of weakening the
social organizing among developers, and shifted the patterns of contributions to
adhere with the technical requirements.
