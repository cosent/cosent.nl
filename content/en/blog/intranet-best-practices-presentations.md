Valuable data and wisdom about intranet and social media
 
 were presented at the first day of #IE10, the
 
 IntraTeam Event 2010 in Copenhagen.

### Jane McConnell - Global Intranet Trends for 2010

Jane McConnell ([@netjmc](http://twitter.com/netjmc))
laced her presentation on the six dimensions (or phases) of
intranet development with plenty of data points from
[The Global Intranet Strategies Survey](http://www.netjmc.net/intranet-trends/).

The 6 dimensions are:

1. The Waltz
:   Controlled, orchestrated.
    Communications 'owns' the intranet.

2. Harmony
:   Bring people together, show the big picture,
    create a smooth experience, feel at home.

3. Let's Go!
:   Energy, good intentions, initiatives all over the place.

4. Control & Politics
:   Single access, gatekeepers, follow the rules, stay inside the firewall.
    The focus is on governance. Work with "Next to top" management and operational
    levels; middle management is threatened and difficult to engage.

5. Free The Intranet
:   New ways of walking, talking. Shortcuts, running, jumping.
    Adoption of social media.

6. You
:   Prepare for a long walk, lay a solid foundation.
    Push the right buttons, stick to your vision.

Some points to take away:

* Mobile is a big growth area
* As is blogs, wikis and home access
* Don't separate social media from the "real" intranet
* Integrate collaboration spaces into the intranet

Intranet is about helping people do their jobs, **now!**

### Andrew Wright and Stephan Schillerwein - Worldwide Intranet Challenge

Andrew Wright
([@roojwright](http://twitter.com/Roojwright))
and Stephan Schillerwein ([@intranetmatters](http://twitter.com/intranetmatters))
presented the outcomes of the
[Worldwide Intranet Challenge (WIC)](http://www.cibasolutions.com.au/)
(see also the [LinkedIn Group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2289431)).

Unlike Jane McConnell's study, which focuses on intranet managers,
the WIC focuses on end users. Organizations sign up,
their staff completes the survey, organizations then
get a summary of findings from their own staff,
plus a benchmark of external findings.

Interesting: if you ask a hall full of intranet professionals,
what *they think* is most important to intranet *end users*,
the number one priority is: finding information (search).

But real end users prioritize: instructions for work tasks, document up/downloads,
policies and procedures, company + industry news.
In short: users want to get work done.
Help them by providing forms that automate common task execution.

An interesting tidbit: one of the case studies didn't use the
term "frequently asked questions"; rather they labeled that section:
"I would like to...". That section got hundreds of page views
each month. Translating each page view in a reduced help
desk call, valued at $15,- per call, the business case was pretty solid.

### Rossen Roussev - Shell Newsdesk

Rossen Roussev presented a case study on how Shell
saved a lot of money by introducing a consolidated
news desk.

The news desk is powered by technology from
[Moreover](http://w.moreover.com/), which
also presents a [writeup of the case](http://w.moreover.com/public/customers/shell-case-study.html).
The initial savings goal was $ 5m, but the actual result is $ 15m and counting,
most of it by replacing the existing 72 news monitoring contracts
with a single, consolidated, integrated technology platform.

Success factors are:

* Seamless integration in the intranet GUI by using the internal branding.
  Users don't even notice they're using an external service
  (dedicated hosting accessed by VPN).
* Smart (automatic) user profiles - the application connects with
  Active Directory and sets up a filter based on function
  and operational unit. The user can use this as a starting
  point for further personalization.
* Don't ever use the term "intranet". Instead, align with
  what's keeping senior management awake at night and
  propose a new "intelligence capability". I liked that one :-)
* Be proactive - reach out to business and functional stakeholders.

This platform allows Shell to integrate competitive intelligence,
brand management, issue management, internal publishing
and media relations.

### Martin White - Is Your Intranet Ready for 2012?

Martin White ([@IntranetFocus](http://twitter.com/IntranetFocus))
highlighted that, unlike most corporate IT efforts that support
defined business processes, the intranet is different: unstructured,
diffuse, without an obvious internal sponsor and owner.

He drew an interesting graph of three growing time curves:

* The amount of information grows relentlessly.
* Staff capacity to handle information grows, but less.
* Actual "findable information" grows even slower.

As a result, an information overload gap opens between
information supply and use, putting business performance and
reputation at risk.

He later returned to that graph, with mitigating actions:

* Filtering reduces the volume of information supply.
* Connecting people increases their handling capacity.

He presented some other relevant models in turbo speed,
hopefully we can see those once the
[slides](http://my.intrateam.dk/gb/pr-sentation/speakers-presentations-intrateam-event-2010)
become available.

Martin offered a concise summary:

### Wanted position - 2012

* #### Employees linked with:

  + each other
  + suppliers
  + customers
  + stakeholders
* #### Intranet independent of:

  + location
  + language
  + department
  + technology
* #### Business sees intranet as:

  + responsive
  + proactive
  + helpful in defining and managing risk
  + decision support

There's some hefty points in there, like location independence, which implies mobile;
language independence, which implies machine translations;
and decision support, which implies elimination of everything that does *not* support decision making.

### More #IE10 to follow

The presentation by Suw Charman-Anderson ([@suw](http://twitter.com/suw))
on social media, email and operant conditioning merits a full blog post on it's own...
Will come back to that later.

The final presentation of the day, by Eric Reiss ([@elreiss](http://twitter.com/elreiss/))
was less splashy (in the literal sense: as in "flying droplets of water") than some people expected. But it was splashy in the presentation sense: full of fervour and fun.
Most important take away: Keep the "why" in focus; work backward from that to the "what".
And an interesting quote from Max de Pree:

> "The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality"

Overall, an interesting day. [IntraTeam](http://www.intrateam.com/Home.aspx) (Twitter: [@intrateam](http://twitter.com/intrateam)) did a good job! Follow the conference's Twitter stream at [#ie10](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23ie10).
