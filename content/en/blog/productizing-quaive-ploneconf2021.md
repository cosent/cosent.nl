Coming from a traditional web consultancy background, we've launched Quaive as a product-centric "built on Plone" solution. We still need our clients to be happy, and we still do a lot of consultancy. 

This talk highlights some of the tensions and pitfalls resulting from a hybrid consultancy-product business model. It covers the importance of: design, expectation management, architecture, and balancing technical debt versus making a quick buck.

This talk takes a product owner perspective and will be useful to both project managers working with clients, and to developers who want to deepen their understanding of the business side.
