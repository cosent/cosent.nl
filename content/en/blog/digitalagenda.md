{{< intro >}}
Defining future internet research priorities for the EU Digital Agenda 2020 Framework Programme.
{{< /intro >}}

The Internet has become crucial to the development of our societies; not
only as an enabling infrastructure, but even more so as a key change driver.

Two conclusions follow from this. First, the huge challenge we're facing to
avoid ecological breakdown and effect a transition to a more sustainable society,
requires an integral role for internet technologies to support that transition.

Second, since internet technologies both enable and drive change, a future-oriented
research agenda for the Internet needs to be grounded in a multi-disciplinary,
holistic approach that integrates the social and the technical.

That, in short, is what the international PARADISO conference was about on September 7-9 2011.
Hosted by the European Commission in Brussels, the conference was dedicated to
producing guidelines for European R&D funding in the 2014-2020 period, involving
a budget of € 50 billion to € 80 billion, called *Horizon 2020*.

The [PARADISO reference document](http://paradiso-fp7.eu/files/2011/05/PARADISO_reference_document_July2011.pdf) summarizes a range of foresight studies
and lists key recommendations for this research effort. It's part of the
EU's [Future Internet](http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/foi/index_en.htm) programme under the umbrella of the [Digital Agenda 2020](http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/digital-agenda/index_en.htm)

The video above provides an impression of the conference.
Below, you'll find summaries of the four conference sessions:

2. [Looking at the future of our societies](digitalagenda/index.html#looking-at-the-future-of-our-societies)
3. [Looking at the future of the internet](digitalagenda/index.html#looking-at-the-future-of-the-internet)
4. [Internet and societies: call to action](digitalagenda/index.html#internet-and-societies-call-to-action)

I'm highlighting the main interesting points but also
provide links to all speech transcripts, slides
and external sites that are relevant.

### Opening session

The opening session consisted mostly of presentations by EU politicians.
I'm not going to bore you with summaries of those. You can read the
full transcripts in the [conference proceedings](http://paradiso-fp7.eu/events/agenda/).
The [opening speech by Neelie Smit-Kroes](http://paradiso-fp7.eu/wp-content/plugins/alcyonis-event-agenda//files/Internet-and-Societies-New-Innovation-Paths.pdf) was certainly interesting.

Some quotes from this session:

[Catherine Trautmann](http://paradiso-fp7.eu/wp-content/plugins/alcyonis-event-agenda//files/Opening-Panel.pdf) MEP:

> "The Internet by itself is a grand societal challenge."

[Anna-Maria Darmanin](http://paradiso-fp7.eu/wp-content/plugins/alcyonis-event-agenda//files/Anna-Maria-Darmanin.pdf) MEP:

> "The new generation was never so well-prepared, never so disappointed"

### Looking at the future of our societies

The second session was by far the most interesting, showcasing
a range of foresight (futures) research studies.

[Marc Luyckx Ghisi](http://paradiso-fp7.eu/wp-content/plugins/alcyonis-event-agenda//files/ICT,-a-New-Civilization.pdf), (former member of the "Foresight Studies Unit" of European Commission's President):

> "The deep motor of the change is that all
> citizen feel that if we continue with our
> actual economic logic, we are in danger
> of collective suicide."

He cited Drucker:

> "That knowledge has become the resource,
> rather than a resource, is what makes our
> society « post-capitalist ». This fact
> changes – fundamentally – the structure
> of society. It creates new social and
> economic dynamic. It creates new politics."

[Carlo Sessa](http://paradiso-fp7.eu/wp-content/plugins/alcyonis-event-agenda//files/Looking-at-the-Future-of-our-Societies.pdf) (President of ISIS, Italy, coordinator of the PASHMINA project and member of the Global Europe 2030-2050 expert group), summarized the [Pashmina Project](http://www.pashmina-project.eu/).
They've developed four scenarios against two axes:
1. Do it fast / Do it slow
2. Do it alone / Do it together

| . | Do it fast | Do it slow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Do it alone | Growth without limits | Stagnation |
| Do it together | Growth within limits | New welfare |

Developing a Vision & Action Roadmap for Sustainable Lifestyles.

She highlighted collaborative consumption and [sustainability scoring](http://wegreen.de/)
of products.

[Dirk Johann](http://paradiso-fp7.eu/wp-content/plugins/alcyonis-event-agenda//files/The-European-Foresight-Platform-(EFP)-and-the-European-Forum-on-FLA.pdf) (Researcher, Austrian Institute of Technology, European Foresight Platform)
introduced the [European Foresight Platform](http://www.foresight-platform.eu/) and
referenced [Mapping Foresight](ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/fp7/ssh/docs/efmn-mapping-foresight.pdf), a meta-study indexing a large number
of foresight studies performed across Europe.

[Philippe Quéau](http://paradiso-fp7.eu/wp-content/plugins/alcyonis-event-agenda//files/PARADISO-=-PARADIgms-+-SOcietal-Issues.pdf) (Representative of UNESCO to the Maghreb)
criticized the policy preference for "ultrafast networks" as harking back
to the outdated "super information highway" metaphor.

He distinguishes:

The "Digital paradigm"
:   *instrumental*, technological impact

The "Information paradigm"
:   *environmental*, wide societal impact

The "Knowledge paradigm"
:   *mental*, deep impact on civilization

and also a new convergence paradigm:

The "BANG paradigm"
:   Bits, Atoms, Neurons, Genes

[Guo Liang](http://paradiso-fp7.eu/wp-content/plugins/alcyonis-event-agenda//files/Metcalf%E2%80%99s-Law,-its-Impact-in-China.pdf) (Deputy Director, Center for Social Development, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences)
shook the (European) audience by applying Metcalfe's law to China.
Already Asia is the continent with most Internet users, double that of Europe.
Chinese usage patterns are distinct from Western patterns: instant messaging instead of email,
a predominance of micro-blogs, work/study focus in internet use.
China is atypical: it's citizens feel that they can influence their government via the Internet.
But also:

> "1/3 of Internet users in China use the Internet only to play games.
> For them, it's nothing more than a game machine."

### Looking at the future of the internet

The next presentations were technology-driven, which was a bit
of a jar after the confronting societal futures presentations that
went before - it's clear that a narrow tech-only focus won't solve our
problems.

[Ashok Jhunjhunwala](http://paradiso-fp7.eu/wp-content/plugins/alcyonis-event-agenda//files/The-Future-of-Internet.-A-View-from-the-Emerging-World.pdf) (Professor, Head of department, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India)
delivered a truly outstanding presentation: [Future of the Internet: a view from the emerging world](http://paradiso-fp7.eu/wp-content/plugins/alcyonis-event-agenda//files/The-Future-of-Internet.-A-View-from-the-Emerging-World.pdf).
This tied together all the themes we had seen: societal challenges, global power shift towards Asia,
the crucial role of technology.
