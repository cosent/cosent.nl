How social intranet design can enable organisational change.
{{< /intro >}}

This talk, presented at [IntraTeam Event 2016](http://event.intrateam.com/events/intrateam-event-2016), introduces a four-type classification of organisational cultures, based on the Cubrix model of organisational development.

Using the example of the iKath intranet of the [Swiss Catholic Church in the canton of Zurich](http://zh.kath.ch/), each of these cultural types shows up as a set of related functionalities in the intranet design.

The layered interaction design is adaptive: users can safely ignore the "social layer" and still have a fully functional user experience that addresses document management and process support. This enables a gradual evolution of organisational change, without requiring retooling.
