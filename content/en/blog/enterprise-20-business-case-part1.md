Organizations need to move away from email, but that requires more than just introducing social technologies.
Part 1 of 3.
{{< /intro >}}

Organizations are in pain.
[Our market research shows](/blog/social-intranet-vibrant-market) that many organizations are confused
about responsibilities and who's doing what. Very basic,
the stuff of [management 1.01](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0787996165/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0787996165&linkCode=as2&tag=cosent-21).

The reason for this is, that many organizations are running
on outdated operating models. They're optimized for the good old times,
when time was slow, the world was assumed to be predictable, and the
boss knew best.

The network revolution has exposed many previously shielded industries
to gale force winds of change. Welcome to the new normal,
where time moves at internet speed, crises trigger more crises,
and [the smartest person in the room is the room](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0465021425/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0465021425&linkCode=as2&tag=cosent-21).

Since external change pressure is not going to let up,
the only solution is to increase the pace of change
an organization is comfortable with.

### Enterprise 2.0

Enter [Enterprise 2.0](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1422125874/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1422125874&linkCode=as2&tag=cosent-21): the application, within the enterprise,
of collaboration tools that have evolved on the open web.

And then something goes wrong. Managers hear "tools" and "web",
and delegate to IT to provide a new "social intranet".
A strategic organizational change requirement just got demoted
to an operational technology issue.
Which then fizzles out, since technology by itself cannot
change organizational performance to the degree that is required.

It doesn't help that most of the management layer grew up
before the web even existed.

### Business Practices That Refuse To Die

It also doesn't help that the web is full of nice stories
like the video below, which presents
*replacing email with social technologies*
as a magic bullet solution.

Sure, email has to be reduced and social technologies
have a lot of potential. But this video hides some
pretty big issues:

* Replacing email with social technology only works if everybody is using the social technology.
* How do you get everybody to use the social technology?
* What do you do when **not** everybody switches away from email?
* Instead of moving ad-hoc processes unchanged to social platforms, isn't there an opportunity to *improve* social decision making processes?

### Outside The Inbox

Luis Suarez, who is famous as the man that lives [outside the inbox](http://www.outsidetheinbox.eu/),
provides a more nuanced picture. If you listen closely to his story,
you'll get an idea of the effort involved to cut down on email.

Social technologies enable us to move away from email.
Doing so requires much more than just sprinkling some "magic technology dust":
it requires people to change their behaviors, and it requires
organizations to change their routines.

In the [part 2](/blog/enterprise-20-business-case-part2/) of this 3-part blog post series, we'll explore
just how big a deal this is.
