{{< intro >}}
PloneSocial provides an open source social business solution, integrated into the Plone CMS.
{{< /intro >}}

At the [World Plone Conference](http://ploneconf.org) 2012, Cosent presented the PloneSocial suite: a social business solution integrated into the open source Plone CMS. A [one-click installer](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plonesocial.suite) provides a full microblogging solution with updates, hashtag support and follow/unfollow social graph filtering of the activity stream. Additionally, the activity stream included in PloneSocial exposes content actions within the CMS, such as creating new pages and commenting on pages.
